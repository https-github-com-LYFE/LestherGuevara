If S is a finite set with |S| = n elements, then the number of subsets of S is |P(S)| = 2n. This fact, which is the motivation for the          notation 2S, may be demonstrated simply as follows, 

First, order the elements of S in any manner. We write any subset of S in the format {γ1, γ2, ..., γn } where γi , 1 ≤ i ≤ n, can take the     value of 0 or 1. If γi = 1, the i-th element of S is in the subset; otherwise, the i-th element is not in the subset. Clearly the number of distinct subsets that can be constructed this way is 2n as γi ∈ {0, 1} .

Artificial life is the simulation of any aspect of life, as through computers, robotics, or biochemistry. The study of artificial life         imitates traditional biology by recreating some aspects of biological phenomena. Scientists study the logic of living systems by        creating artificial environments—seeking to understand the complex information processing that defines such systems. While life     is, by     definition, alive, artificial life is generally referred to as data confined to a digital environment and existence. 

Synthetic biology is a new area of biotechnology that combines science and biological engineering. The common goal is the design and               construction of new biological functions and systems not found in nature. Synthetic biology includes the broad redefinition and     expansion of biotechnology, with the ultimate goals of being able to design and build engineered biological systems that process  information, manipulate chemicals, fabricate materials and structures, produce energy, provide food, and maintain and enhance human health   and the environment.
